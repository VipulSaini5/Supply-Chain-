# 📦 *AtliQ Mart: Supply Chain Performance Dashboard*

*Project Overview:*

AtliQ Mart is a fast-growing FMCG manufacturer based in Gujarat, India, operating in three major cities: Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. As the company plans to expand to more Tier 1 cities over the next two years, it faces a critical challenge—some key customers have not renewed their annual contracts due to *service issues* like delayed or incomplete deliveries. 

To address this, the management team tasked the Supply Chain Analytics department with daily tracking of service performance using three key metrics:

- *🚚 On-Time Delivery (OT %)* 
- *📦 In-Full Delivery (IF %)* 
- *⚡ On-Time In-Full (OTIF %)*
  
As a newly joined data analyst on the team, I developed a Power BI dashboard to help monitor these metrics in real-time, enabling the company to respond quickly and enhance customer satisfaction.

## 📊 *Key Metrics Tracked:*
- *On-Time Delivery %*: Measures how often deliveries are made within the promised time frame.
- *In-Full Delivery %*: Tracks whether all ordered items were delivered completely.
- *On-Time In-Full (OTIF %)*: Combines both timeliness and completeness of deliveries, a crucial metric for customer satisfaction.

## 🔍 *Key Learnings & Highlights*:
